# Particle Simulation
![]() <img src="https://github.com/JosiaOrava/particleSimulation/blob/main/img/sand.gif" width="400">
<br>This is hobby project done by me to learn more on making particle physics.
<br> It is made completely on Python and currently has particles for stone and sand. Stone will remain in place where you put it and sand falls and spreads.

## What I learned
This project has teached me to work with Cellular Automation, OOP and Python library called PyGame.
<br> I'm sure my way of doing things isn't the most optimal and once I have added few other particle materials I will work on optimizing.

## Future features
Next I am working on water element and after that fire and distruction.
<br> After those I will work on optimizing this sense now it runs into problems when there are many particles because it runs every frame alot of calculations on each particle.
